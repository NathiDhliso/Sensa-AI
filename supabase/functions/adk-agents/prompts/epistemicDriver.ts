Analyze the following list of exam objectives. Group them into a logical, nested structure.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Identify the main domains (e.g., "Manage Azure identities and governance (20â€“25%)")
2. List the specific sub-topics that belong to each domain
3. Ensure all topics are captured and properly categorized
4. Use clear, descriptive domain names

STRUCTURED INPUT DATA:
${JSON.stringify(groupedData, null, 2)}

CREATE A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY MAP WITH THREE PARTS:

PART 1: EPISTEMOLOGICAL DRIVERS (The "Why" - Foundation)
Generate exactly 3 points using this scaffold:
- Concept/Fact: Core foundational knowledge
- Process/Explanation: How the concepts work together  
- Implication/Application: Why this matters in practice

PART 2: LEARNING PATHS (The "How" & "So What" for each domain)
For each domain in the input data, create:

Methodology & Practice (The "How"):
- Technical Component: Core technical elements to master
- Operational Process: Step-by-step implementation approach
- Direct Result: Immediate outcomes of mastery

Application & Impact (The "So What"):
- Strategic Driver: High-level business/strategic rationale
- Execution Strategy: How to implement in real scenarios
- Business Impact: Tangible benefits and outcomes

PART 3: CONNECTING LINK
One sentence connecting the foundational "Why" to the detailed learning paths.
