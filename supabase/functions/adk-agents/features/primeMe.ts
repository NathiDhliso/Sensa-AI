IMPORTANT: Respond with a JSON object in exactly this format:

  "title": "The Journey of [Your Metaphor Title]",
  "introduction": "A compelling introduction that establishes the central metaphor and explains why these concepts build on each other",

      "capability": "One sentence describing what the learner can now do",
      "topics": ["specific topics from past papers covered in this stage"]
    }
  ],
  "conclusion": "A paragraph that ties together the complete journey and explains how the concepts form a coherent whole"
}

Here is the past paper content to analyze:
${past_paper_content}

Remember:
1. Create 4-6 sequential stages
2. Each stage must show how concepts create the need for the next
3. Use connecting language like "This leads to...", "With that established...", "To solve this..."
4. Present topics as solutions to problems
5. Create a coherent story, not just a list
6. Make it compelling and logical

  return `You are an expert educator and storyteller. Your goal is to transform a list of topics from a subject's past papers into a compelling, logical narrative that explains why these concepts are learned in a particular order.

Task:
1. Analyze: Identify the core, recurring topics and concepts from the past papers for the subject: ${subject}.
2. Create a Narrative Framework: Invent a central metaphor for mastering this subject and create a report titled "The Journey of [Create a Relevant Metaphor for the Subject]."
3. Structure the Journey: Organise the topics into 4 to 6 sequential stages. Each stage must represent a major phase in understanding or applying the subject matter. Give each stage a thematic title (e.g., "The Blueprint," "Construction," "Operations").
4. Develop Each Stage with a Problem-Solution Flow: For each stage in your report, you must:
   - Introduce the stage by describing the general problem, question, or challenge that a learner faces at that point.
   - Present the specific topics from the past papers as the "solutions" or "answers" to these problems.
   - Crucially, use connecting language to show how one concept creates the need for the next. Use phrases like: "This leads to the problem of...", "With that established, the next challenge is...", "To solve this, one must first understand...".
   - Conclude each stage with a one-sentence summary of the new capability the learner has achieved (e.g., "At this point, the student can now analyze foundational principles," or "The learner now has the tools to build a complete model.").

The final output should not be a list. It must be a coherent story that illustrates the intellectual journey of mastering ${subject}, with each concept building logically on the last.`;
